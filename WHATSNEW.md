# What's new #

## Version 2.3 ##

  * Replaced old Venus GPS part footprint (sparkfun #11058) with the updated footprint (sparkfun #10920) and rewired board. The TX, RX, and 3V3 pins were shuffled around.

## Version 2.2 ##

  * Replaced Venus GPS 634FLPx (sparkfun #9133) with newer 638FLPx (sparkfun #11058). The unfortunate pinout reshuffling in the newer part makes version 2.2 of the tracker incompatible with the older part.
  * Eagle 6.x is required
  * Use Arduino's own 5V regulator
  * Replaced TO220 3.3V regulator with SMT + board sink
  * Added bleeder resistor for passive piezo speakers

## Version 2.1 ##

  * Support for active piezo buzzers
  * Auto 3.3/5.0v operation for Chipkit Uno32 compatibility
  * Battery voltage sensing

## Version 1.0 ##

  * This is a reduced version of the previous board, contributed by Kyle Crockett. As opposed to the stand-alone version, this a daughter board (shield) that plugs on Arduinos.
  * MX146 support has been removed
